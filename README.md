## 8-1 Journal: Portfolio Submission

### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

In this assignment I played the role of a software developer for an engineering firm called Global Rain. Global Rain provides experties for companies who want to build custom software solutions. In particual, they focus on building security into all of their client's applications. As an employee of Global Rain, I was assigned to a team working on a project for Artemis Finanical. Artemis Financial is a consulting firm that helps indivivuals build personalized plans to meet their future financial needs. The primary goals for the project were to:

- Analyze the current system using both static dependency scanning and manual code reviews to identify possible security vunerabilities.
- Research security issues to determine their impact on the system and filter out false positives.
- Provide recommendations on how to mitigate any security vulnerabilities or risks that were discovered.
- Analyze and recommend secure encryption ciphers and hashing algorithsm.
- Refactor code to implement secure communications between the browser-based client and the application server.
- Implement a mechanism to verify data integrity using a secure hashing algorithm.
- Address other security issues found in the code to imporove the overall security of the application.

### What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

### What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

### How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

### How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
